\begin{figure}[h!]
\noindent\includegraphics[width=5.8 in]{SI_fig_synthetic_noise.pdf}
\caption{The left panel is the inversion for five paleomagnetic poles generated during a net $100^\circ$ rotation about an Euler pole at $00^\circ$N, $000^\circ$E over 100 Myr and is the same that is shown in Figure 4 of the main text. The right panel is an example where noise is introduced in terms of the position of the synthetic poles and their age for the same rotation. The inversion is able to recover the true Euler position and rate within the credible intervals of the posterior distributions although these credible intervals are larger in the case of the added noise. This analysis is conducted in the PEP$\_$synthetic.ipynb Jupyter notebook that is contained in the archived code.}

\caption{The probability distribution associated with Watson girdle distributions comparing that arising from the Euler pole prior analysis in Figure 3 that yielded $\kappa_w=-0.7$ and that of $\kappa_w=-0.1$ that was used for a less informed prior associated with inversions.  $\kappa_w=-0.1$ is shown with the same color bar as $\kappa_w=-0.7$ in the middle panel and with a color bar that is scaled to the 2 and 98 percentile of the density in the right panel.}
